## Developer guide

React-SearchKit uses [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) as development toolkit.

```
npm install
```

Start the demo application:

```
npm start
```

The library uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as test runner. To run the tests:

```

```

The library uses `babel` to build a final version inside the `/lib` folder:

```
npm build
```
