title: Filters And Aggregations

[Filters](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-filter-context.html#filter-context) and [Aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html) are normally used when working with Elasticsearch.

However, they can be applied to any backend or REST APIs.

## Aggregations

Aggregations can be defined as a set of complex summaries for the search results. Or in other words, a grouping of the search results to provide different statistics. For example, the number of results of each specific value of a field.
