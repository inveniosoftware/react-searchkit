`ResultsMultiLayout` is an uncontrolled component that listens to the application's `layout` state and
renders results in a `list` ([ResultsList](components/results_list.md)) or `grid` ([ResultsGrid](components/results_grid.md))
respectively. Can be used in combination with the `LayoutSwitcher` component to change the results layout in controllable way.
By default it renders results as a list.

## Usage

```
<ResultsMultiLayout />
```
